The R function, 'Loran.f', uses the 32-bit DOS executable 'GPTOTD.EXE' to convert Loran coordinates to lat/long in R.

The 'Example R Code.R' script has looping software to allow conversion of large data sets. 

For GPTOTD.EXE go to:

   https://www.loran.org/software.htm  ('GP to TD Zip' under Program Files
   ).
    
 Keep the 3 DATUM files (FWGS84, FWGS72, FNAD) in the same folder as GPTOTD.EXE.
